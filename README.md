# Desktop-Calculator
I have done this project using the python Tkinter library. Steps that I have followed are as follows:-

Building a basic template using python library Tkinter for eg:- adding a button for number and operator.
Creating functions for evaluating expression by the user which is done using parser library in python(if the expression is wrong then print an Error message on screen). 
Steps for evaluating an expression. 
a) Evaluating Expression entered by the user i.e creating a parse tree with the help of the parser library. 
b) using .compile() function on parse tree object to convert it in byte code format and using eval() function to evaluate expression which is present in byte code format.
They have taught basic functionalities like add, sub, div, and mul. I have added factorial button which calculates the factorial of number by using factorial logic. It evaluates expression first and then applies factorial logic.

To Run this application you can use repl.it or pycharm app.
Just copy this code in calculator.py file to your application and run this file.
